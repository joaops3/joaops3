### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! i'm JoÃ£o 

## About Me

FullStack developer, I have hands-on experience with different technologies, and Iâ€™m always open to exploring new tools and paradigms that best suit each challenge.

Currently, Iâ€™ve been working mainly with technologies like Node.js, Golang, TypeScript, React, Next.js, NestJS, and AWS. Always excited to adapt and grow within different stacks and environments.

I also enjoy experimenting with dApps and smart contract development with solidity. Constantly tuned into new crypto projects.
